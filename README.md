# Skills

In this project, I was able to:

   * Make requests and consume data from an `API`;

   * Use the life cycles of a React component;

   * Use the `setState` function to ensure that a given code is only executed after the state is updated
  
   * Use the `BrowserRouter` component correctly;

   * Create routes, mapping the URL path with the corresponding component, via `Route`;

   * Use `Switch` from `React Router`

   * Use the `Redirect` component to redirect to a specific route;

   * Create navigation links in the application with the `Link` component;

   - List the available albums of this band or artist;
   - View songs from a selected album;
   - Play a preview of the songs from this album;
